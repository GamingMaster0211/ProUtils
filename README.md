# Information About ProUtils

ProUtils is a software programmed in multiple coding languages, as it has
support for those languages. It is a software that helps developers make
a utility file (albeit this is a useless software for the experienced) in
multiple languages.

EVERY SINGLE SOURCE AND LIBRARY USED IN PROUTILS IS MADE BY ME. NO ONE ELSE.

ProUtils CURRENTLY has support for:

- Python

ProUtils WILL have support for:

- Java
- C++
- C#
- C

More support will be added soon, as well as incoming support.

# Requirements For Use Of ProUtils Python Edition

Requirements:

- TKinter
- PyMsgBox
- Preferably LATEST Python version. I'm unsure with how this will respond to earlier versions of Python.

# Instructions For Use Of ProUtils Python Edition

Instructions:

1. Launch main.py. Hopefully you do this from Visual Studio Code incase something messes up so you can fix it.
2. In the first box, input the name of the utility file to create.
3. In the second box, input the factor of the utility file to create. This is currently being worked on, so beware it has no use as of now.
4. Execute On Run (EOR) when toggled on, it will add auto-generated code to the utility file to automatically run when a Python entry point file is run.
5. Create Utility just creates the utility file. The file gets saved into the "uc" directory.
6. The help button just gives you these instructions but not in GitHub.

# Final Words

I plan on (in the future) to add support for more languages. I've only had time to do Python these past couple of days.
I hope you enjoy this useless software. Why is it useless? You can just create the file yourself. But other than that, thank you for downloading ProUtils Python Edition!
